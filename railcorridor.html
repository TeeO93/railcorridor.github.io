</figure>
<div> Its origins started from January 1903 where the first section of the Singapore Railway was built, stretching from Tank Road to Bukit Timah and consisted of four 
stations on the line: Singapore, Newton, Cluny and Bukit Timah. Extension of the Singapore Railway came in a second phase in 1907, where there was an extension to 
Pasir Panjang and Woodlands. After subsequent modifications to the railway track in 1966, an additional 19km-long branch was added to the Singapore Railway Line, 
forming the most recent version of the Railway Line, starting from Tanjong Pagar and ending at Woodlands Train Checkpoint. In 2011, this Railway Line was 
decommissioned and subsequently not in use, leading to the formation of the Rail Corridor upon removal of the train tracks along this route. </div>

</figure>
<div> Before the Tanjong Pagar Railway station was completed in 1932, passengers taking the trains boarded and alighted at Tank Road station. Tanjong Pagar Railway 
Station was owned by Malaysia’s Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) and is the southernmost terminal of the Malaysian Railway (West Coast Line), which connected the railway 
stations all the way to the Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint which is the beginning point for another railway track connecting Singapore to Malaysia. It reflected a rich 
Malaysian heritage with murals reflecting said culture. In April 2011, it has been conserved by the government as a national monument, preserving heritage from its heyday 
and legacy. </div>

<div> The Bukit Timah Railway Station opened in 1915 connected one end of the line to Tank Road Terminal and the other end was connected to Malaysia via Kranji and Woodlands. 
Similar to most of the other stations, it was decommisioned in 2011 and now the railway tracks are open to the public for nature walks, and is now the central part of Rail 
Corridor, where certain nature parks exist near this region of the Rail Corridor. </div>

<div> Unlike other train stations which were decommisioned in 2011, it is now the sole train station that links to the Malaysian rail system directly and is now still 
functioning in order to transport travellers from Singapore to Johor and vice versa, as well as a checkpoint to regulate the flow of people between the two lands. </div>
